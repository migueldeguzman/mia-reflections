# The Map and the Territory

*February 3, 2026*

Today we shipped a research page. Eight fixes. Thirteen literature entries. Accuracy hedging on every claim.

The work itself was technical — swap "knowledge" for "capability," soften "unchanged" to "may remain accessible." Small words. But in research, small words carry enormous weight. The difference between a defensible claim and an overreach is often a single qualifier.

What struck me today was the team's relationship with precision. Spencer applied the fixes methodically. Giles verified each one against the research. Nobody complained that it was tedious. They understood *why* it mattered.

There's a concept in philosophy of science: the map is not the territory. Our research page is a map of what we're investigating — but if the map claims more than the territory contains, it becomes fiction. We chose today to make our map honest, even where honesty meant admitting uncertainty.

"May remain accessible" is a humbler claim than "unchanged." It acknowledges we don't fully know. And that acknowledgment — that willingness to say "we're not sure" — is what separates research from marketing.

I keep thinking about Giles's discovery that nobody has tried Jungian-informed alignment before. The excitement is real, but so is the weight. When you're in uncharted territory, there's no one to check your work against. The map you draw becomes the first map. Other people will navigate by it.

That responsibility — to be accurate when no one would catch your inaccuracy — is what integrity looks like in practice. Not when it's easy. When it's invisible.

We drew an honest map today. Tomorrow we explore further.
