## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 9-phase structure | Derived from 8 requirement categories with e-invoicing split for complexity | 2026-01-23 |
| E-invoicing as critical path | July 2026 pilot deadline makes EINV phases time-critical | 2026-01-23 |
| Foundation-first approach | Multi-tenant and audit infrastructure enables all compliance features | 2026-01-23 |
| Cross-database reference pattern | UUID/code lookups for master-to-tenant DB references (no FK across DBs) | 2026-01-23 |
| Singleton compliance config | One tenant_compliance_config per tenant DB (company-wide settings) | 2026-01-23 |
| COMPLIANCE permission module | Groups FTA/regulatory permissions separately from finance CRUD | 2026-01-23 |
| Jest mock with type assertions | Tests run before schema migrations, mocks bypass Prisma type issues | 2026-01-23 |
| Raw SQL for master DB queries | Master Prisma client not separately generated; use masterDatabaseService | 2026-01-23 |
| compliance_config.view/update | Permission codes follow tax_config pattern for consistency | 2026-01-23 |
| Nullable tamper-proof fields | Pre-migration records retain NULL; hash chain starts fresh | 2026-01-24 |
| Database-level immutability | PostgreSQL trigger prevents UPDATE/DELETE as defense-in-depth | 2026-01-24 |
| Partial unique constraint | sequenceNumber unique allows NULL for backward compatibility | 2026-01-24 |
| Standalone hash in tests | Tests verify hash algorithm independently from service implementation | 2026-01-24 |
| Mock Prisma for immutability | Trigger behavior tested via mocked rejection; real trigger at migration | 2026-01-24 |
| Raw SQL for hash chain | Avoids Prisma model name issues, ensures SEQUENCE compatibility | 2026-01-24 |
| Local sanitize method | Parent class sanitize() is private; local method avoids inheritance conflicts | 2026-01-24 |
| Unified ApprovalDocumentType | Standard financial + FTA types in one enum for unified workflow system | 2026-01-24 |
| Role placeholders in seed | Role IDs vary per tenant; placeholders allow workflow creation before roles | 2026-01-24 |
| Idempotent workflow seeding | findFirst check before create; safe to run multiple times | 2026-01-24 |

### Technical Notes

- Express.js backend, React frontend, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Multi-tenant with company-scoped isolation already exists
- Arabic support already exists (useful for bilingual invoices)
- Basic VAT calculations exist but need FTA upgrade
- PEPPOL PINT-AE is the UAE e-invoicing standard (not ZATCA/FATOORA)

**Phase 1 Deliverables:**
- `free_zones` table (master DB): 27 UAE free zones with designation status
- `industry_codes` table (master DB): 38 ISIC-aligned industry codes
- `tenant_compliance_config` table (tenant DB): Per-tenant TRN, free zone, industry config
- `tax_code_mappings` table (tenant DB): Tenant-specific tax code configurations
- `TrnStatus`, `FreeZoneStatus`, `FilingFrequency` enums
- 4 compliance permissions (config.view, config.edit, trn.verify, taxcode.manage)
- ComplianceConfigService with TRN validation (15-digit pattern)
- ComplianceConfigController with permission middleware
- Routes at `/api/finance/compliance-config`
- 40 integration tests (all passing)

**Phase 2 Deliverables:**
- Tamper-proof audit schema (sequenceNumber, previousHash, recordHash)
- 13 FTA audit action types in AuditAction enum
- PostgreSQL immutability trigger (audit_logs_immutable)
- TypeScript types for hash chain (audit.types.ts)
- ComplianceAuditService with logWithHashChain() for FTA compliance
- AuditIntegrityService with verifyIntegrity() and verifyRecentRecords()
- DI container integration (TYPES.ComplianceAuditService, TYPES.AuditIntegrityService)
- ApprovalDocumentType enum (12 types: 7 standard + 5 FTA)
- ApproverType enum (ROLE, SPECIFIC_USER, ANY_APPROVER)
- approval_workflows and approval_workflow_levels models
- 5 FTA workflow templates with 12 approval levels total
- seedFtaApprovalWorkflows() idempotent seed function
- 59 integration tests for compliance audit (all passing)
